    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A scrumptious omelette I made for breakfast with some besties out in Scarborough, Western Cape. Packed with flavourful mushrooms, piquanté peppers, and basil (with optional bacon bits for the meat-lovers).</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>(Serves 4)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 Eggs</li>
        <li>250g Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Small jar of piquanté peppers</li>
        <li>Pack of basil</li>
        <li>250g mature cheddar chease</li>
        <li>(Optional) Bacon strips, 2 per meat-eater</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>(Optional) Fry the bacon strips in a non-stick pan. I like making them nice and crispy to add some additional crunch to the omelette, but cook them to your liking. Once done, set them aside on a paper towel. Cut into bite-sized bits when cooled.</li>
        <li>If your veggie friends don't mind, use the same pan to cook the mushrooms. Add some butter or oil to the pan, then chuck in the mushrooms. Season generously. </li>
        <li>While the mushrooms are cooking, grate the cheese and rinse and pick the basil. Once the mushrooms are done, remove them from the pan. Your omelette fillings are now all ready!</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a measuring jug and whisk them together with some salt and pepper until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Wipe down your pan and drizzle in some oil. Shift the pan around until the oil has coated most of the surface. When hot, pour in a 1/4 of your egg mixture. As the liquid solidifies, go around the edges of the omelette with a spatula to lift it from the pan.</li>
        <li>On one half of the omelette, spoon in some mushrooms, piquanté peppers and bacon. Sprinkle over some basil and top with a good helping of cheese.</li>
        <li>When the top of the omelette has cooked enough that it's only ever-so-slightly runny, it's time to fold over:
            <ul>
                <li>Insert your spatula under the side of the omelette that isn't topped with ingredients and make sure that side isn't stuck to the pan.</li> 
                <li>You're actually going to use the shaft of the spatula to fold over, not the head, so move the spatula head under the ingredient-filled side of the omelette. The shaft should now be under the empty side of the omelette.</li>
                <li>In a lever-like motion, tilt the spatula so that the shaft folds the empty side of the omelette over onto the filled side. A slight tilt of the pan might help it along. Voila!</li> 
            </ul>
        <li>Allow your lovely folded omelette to heat through on the pan for about a minute. You can shift it around a bit to make sure it's not stuck.</li>
        <li>The last tricky bit: plating up. Don't attempt to lift the omelette off the pan! Rather bring the pan to the plate. Tilt the pan and use your spatula to gently guide the omelette from the pan to the plate in one fluid motion, like shifting a kitten from your lap to the couch while it sleeps.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 5 to 9 to make the rest of your omelettes, then join your friends to dig in and soak up some compliments for your cooking!</li>  
    </ol>
